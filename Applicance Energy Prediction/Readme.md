# Applicance Energy Prediction:

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction

## Assignment 1:

### Machine Learning Models:

 - Linear and Logistic Regression

### Goal:

 - Implement a linear regression model on the dataset to predict the energy usage of appliances. 
 
 - implement the gradient descent algorithm with batch update (all training examples used at once). 
 
 - Use the sum of squared error normalized by (2 x number of samples [J(β0, β1) = (1/2m)[Σ(yᶺ(i) – y(i))2]) as your cost and error measures, where m is number of samples

### Experimentation:
	1. Experiment with various parameters for linear and logistic regression (e.g. learning rate ∝) and report on your findings as how the error/accuracy varies for train and test sets with varying these parameters.
	
	2. Experiment with various thresholds for convergence for linear regression. Plot error results for train and test sets as a function of threshold
